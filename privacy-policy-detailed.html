</p>

<p>
<strong>Acceptance of Terms:</strong> By downloading, installing, accessing, or playing Ultimate Fighting Simulator, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately cease use of the App and uninstall it from your device.
</p>

<p>
<strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> All in-app purchases are final and non-refundable except as required by applicable law or the respective app store policies (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). Virtual items, currency, and premium features purchased through the App have no real-world monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash or other consideration. We make no guarantees regarding the availability, functionality, or satisfaction with any purchased content. Purchase disputes must be resolved through the applicable app store's refund process.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, MCR Partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of the App or any privacy-related claims.
</p>

<p>
<strong>No Warranty:</strong> The App and all related services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any data stored will be fully protected against unauthorized access or loss.

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

<h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
<p>
When you authenticate via Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In, or Firebase email authentication, we may collect your name, email address, profile photo (if provided), and authentication credentials. Firebase Authentication handles verification emails, password resets, and security notifications as necessary for account management.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
<p>The App automatically collects device information (model, operating system, language settings), IP address, general location data derived from IP address, in-app activity and gameplay metrics, error logs, crash reports, performance data, and advertising identifiers used by AdMob.</p>

<h3>1.3 Payment Information</h3>
<p>
All payment processing is handled by Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We do not store payment card information. Purchase validation is managed through RevenueCat in accordance with app store policies.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
<p>We use collected information to maintain user accounts, sync gameplay progress, process in-app purchases, serve advertisements via AdMob, analyze app performance, detect fraud and prevent abuse, provide customer support, and comply with legal obligations.</p>

<p>Under GDPR, we process personal data based on performance of contract (account features, purchases), legitimate interests (analytics, security, fraud prevention), consent (where required for personalized advertising), and legal obligations (compliance with applicable laws).</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob collects advertising identifiers, device information, IP address, ad interaction data, and diagnostic information. In certain jurisdictions, users may be presented with consent options for ad personalization through Google's User Messaging Platform.
</p>

<p>Users may limit ad tracking through device settings: iOS users via Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking; Android users via Settings → Google → Ads. Additional information regarding Google's advertising practices is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Analytics</h2>
<p>Firebase Analytics is used to collect usage trends, gameplay behavior, device performance data, crash data, and feature interaction metrics. See Firebase's privacy policy at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App integrates with Firebase (authentication and analytics), Google AdMob (advertising), RevenueCat (purchase validation), Apple App Store and Google Play Store (payment processing), and third-party authentication providers (Facebook, Google, Apple). Each service operates under its own privacy policy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other jurisdictions where our service providers operate. For EU users, such transfers are governed by Standard Contractual Clauses and other legally compliant transfer mechanisms. Service provider privacy policies: Firebase (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Data Subject Rights</h2>
<p>Users in certain jurisdictions have rights regarding their personal information, including rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. Users may also have the right to data portability and to object to certain processing activities.</p>

<p>EU residents may exercise these rights by contacting ultimatefightingsim@gmail.com. We will respond to verified requests in accordance with applicable law. EU residents also have the right to lodge complaints with their local supervisory authority (<a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>).</p>

<p>California residents have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including rights to know what personal information is collected (identifiers such as email, name, device ID, advertising ID; internet activity such as gameplay data, app usage, ad interactions; geolocation data; commercial information such as purchase history), to access personal information, to request deletion of personal information, and to correct inaccurate information. California residents may exercise these rights by contacting ultimatefightingsim@gmail.com. We do not sell personal information. Requests will be processed in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>Verification may be required to process data subject requests. Response times are governed by applicable legal requirements.</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Personal information is retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. Active account data is retained during account use and for a reasonable period following account deletion. Purchase records are retained as required for tax and legal compliance (typically 7 years). Analytics data is anonymized in accordance with our service providers' policies. Security logs and crash reports are retained for operational periods.</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable security measures to protect information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encrypted data transmission, secure authentication mechanisms, and access controls. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is completely secure.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. The effective date will reflect the date of the most recent revision. Continued use of the App following any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy. Material changes may be communicated through in-app notifications or other means.
